"ARYA (pushing BRAN): Move!
"
"ARYA: Where’s the Imp?
"
"ARYA: Arya.
"
"ARYA: That’s Jaime Lannister. The queen’s twin brother.
"
"ARYA: Where’s the Imp?
"
"Arya Stark: Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. ""My things weren't properly folded"", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway.
"
"Arya Stark: Watch. Nymeria, gloves.
"
"Arya Stark:  Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!
"
"Arya Stark:  A present?
"
"Arya Stark:  It's so skinny.
"
"Arya Stark: I can be quick.
"
"Arya Stark: I think so.
"
"Arya Stark:  I know which end to use.
"
"Arya Stark:  Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.
"
"Arya Stark: What are you doing here? Go away.
"
"Arya Stark: He's my friend.
"
"Arya Stark: Stop it!
"
"Arya Stark:  Nymeria!
"
"Arya Stark:  You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
"
"Arya Stark:  Go!
"
"Arya Stark:  I'm sorry.
"
"Arya Stark: No.
"
"Arya Stark:  That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
"
"Arya Stark:  That's not what happened!
"
"Arya Stark:  Liar!
"
"Arya Stark: Liar! Liar liar liar!
"
"Arya Stark:  Liar liar liar!
"
"Arya Stark: Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!
"
"Arya Stark:  I'm practicing.
"
"Arya Stark: The Prince.
"
"Arya Stark: He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
"
"Arya Stark: The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
"
"Arya Stark: You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.
"
"Arya Stark: Go away!
"
"Arya Stark:  Mine.
"
"Arya Stark: I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
"
"Arya Stark:  It's called Needle.
"
"Arya Stark: Stick 'em with the pointy end.
"
"Arya Stark: I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
"
"Arya Stark: I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.
"
"Arya Stark: So was I! He is a liar.
"
"Arya Stark: But how you can let her marry someone like that?
"
"Arya Stark: Winter is coming.
"
"Arya Stark: I don't hate her. Not really.
"
"Arya Stark: I can keep it?
"
"Arya Stark:  Who are you?
"
"Arya Stark:  It's too heavy.
"
"Arya Stark: What if I drop it?
"
"Arya Stark: I'm a girl.
"
"Arya Stark:  A needle.
"
"Arya Stark: Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
"
"Arya Stark: Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
"
"Arya Stark: He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.
"
"Arya Stark: Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?
"
"Arya Stark:He wants to be a knight of the King’s Guard. He can't be one now, can he?
"
"Arya Stark: Can I be Lord of a holdfast?
"
"Arya Stark: No. That's not me.
"
"Arya Stark: Why do they call you Littlefinger?
"
"Arya Stark: Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
"
"Arya Stark: I'm not a beggar. I live here.
"
"Arya Stark: I want to see my father.
"
"Arya Stark: My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?
"
"Arya Stark: They said they were going to kill you.
"
"Arya Stark: I didn't see them, but I think one was fat.
"
"Arya Stark: I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
"
"Arya Stark: In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls.
"
"Arya Stark: Chasing a cat.
"
"Arya Stark: I'm a girl!
"
"Arya Stark: How many guards does my father have?
"
"Arya Stark: You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?
"
"Arya Stark:  I don’t want to practice today.
"
"Arya Stark: They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don’t care about stupid wooden swords.
"
"Arya Stark:  Yes -
"
"Arya Stark: I don’t like dolls and k -
"
"Arya Stark:  Are you dying because of your leg? Is that why you’re sending us home?
"
"Arya Stark:  You can’t. I’ve got my lessons with Syrio. I’m finally getting good.
"
"Arya Stark:  Can’t we take Syrio back with us?
"
"Arya Stark: Seven hells.
"
"Arya Stark: The lion’s not his sigil, idiot. He’s a stag, like his father.
"
"Arya Stark:  Come on! (dragging Sansa)
"
"Arya Stark:  You said right, but you went left.
"
"Arya Stark:  Only 'cause you lied.
"
"Arya Stark:  I was so. I watched, but you...
"
"Arya Stark:  My father wouldn't send you.
"
"Arya Stark:  And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
"
"Arya Stark:  Come with me. Run.
"
"Arya Stark:  Not today.
"
"Arya Stark:  Not today. Not today.
"
"Arya Stark:  Needle.
"
"Arya Stark:  What do you want?
"
"Arya Stark:  Leave me be. My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
"
"Arya Stark:  Stay away!
"
"Arya Stark:  Could l have one? A lemon one or any of them.
"
"Arya Stark:  How about a nice fat pigeon?
"
"Arya Stark:  Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?
"
"Arya Stark:  Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?
"
"Arya Stark:  Who?
"
"Arya Stark:  Let me go.
"
"Arya Stark:  l'm not a boy!
"
"Arya Stark:  Arry.
"
"Arya Stark:  (pointing Needle at Hot Pie) You want it? l'll give it to you. l already killed one fat boy. l bet you never killed anyone. l bet you're a liar. But l'm not. l'm good at killing fat boys. l like killing fat boys.
"
"Arya Stark:  lt was a gift.
"
"Arya Stark:  Which are you?
"
"ARYA: (Stops walking). What do you want?
"
"ARYA: (Walks toward the cave). I have friends.
"
"ARYA: You should have asked nicely.
"
"ARYA: They don't scare me.
"
"ARYA: What are gold cloaks doing this far from King's Landing?
"
"ARYA: They're looking for me.
"
"ARYA: If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants.
"
"ARYA: Liar.
"
"ARYA: So?
"
"ARYA: (Gendry walks over to get more water). Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle.
"
"ARYA: What do the gold cloaks want with you?
"
"ARYA: You're a liar.
"
"ARYA: Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. (Follows him).
"
"ARYA: No good's ever come? Who asked questions before?
"
"ARYA: Who asked questions?
"
"ARYA: Lord Stark.
"
"ARYA: What did they ask about?
"
"ARYA: Who's your mom?
"
"ARYA: And who was your father?
"
"ARYA: I'm not a girl!
"
"ARYA: Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that.
"
"ARYA: I am not!
"
"ARYA: I don't need to take a piss… Lommy and Hot Pie can’t know. No one can know.
"
"ARYA: My name's not Arry. It's Arya. Of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
"
"ARYA: He was never a traitor! Joffrey is a liar.
"
"ARYA: No. I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister -
"
"ARYA: Do not call me milady.
"
"ARYA: I can't sleep.
"
"ARYA: I don't like the taste.
"
"ARYA: How do you sleep?
"
"ARYA: But you've seen things, horrible things.
"
"ARYA: How do you sleep when you When you have those things in your head?
"
"ARYA: I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queen and and my sister.
"
"ARYA: Get up.
"
"ARYA:  No, I'm not afraid.
"
"ARYA: No!
"
"ARYA: You want Gendry? You already got him. He loved that helmet.
"
"ARYA: Dragon fire.
"
"ARYA: Dead people.
"
"ARYA: Does anyone live?
"
"ARYA: Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
"
"ARYA: The Mountain. What are you doing?
"
"ARYA: Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
"
"ARYA: Polliver. The Mountain.
"
"ARYA: Safer to travel, my lord.
"
"ARYA: Maidenpool, my lord.
"
"ARYA: House Mooton, my lord.
"
"ARYA: (nods.)
"
"ARYA: Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.
"
"ARYA: They call him the Young Wolf.
"
"ARYA: They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.
"
"ARYA: No, my lord. Anyone can be killed.
"
"ARYA: (gasps)
"
"ARYA: I was always a girl.
"
"ARYA: You're one of them now. I should have let you burn.
"
"ARYA:  I didn't have a choice.
"
"ARYA: Three what?
"
"ARYA: I can name anyone and you'll kill him?
"
"ARYA: The one who tortures everyone.
"
"ARYA: I don't know his name. They call him the Tickler.
"
"ARYA: You should stand sideface.
"
"ARYA: Sideways.
"
"ARYA: Smaller target.
"
"ARYA: You're practicing for a fight. You should practice right.
"
"ARYA: Pardon, my lord.
"
"ARYA: My father, my lord.
"
"ARYA: A stonemason.
"
"ARYA: He taught himself.
"
"ARYA: Loyalty.
"
"ARYA: Did... Forgive me, my lord. I shouldn't ask questions.
"
"ARYA: Did you know your father, my lord?
"
"ARYA: I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord.
"
"ARYA: The armory, my lord.
"
"ARYA: Lord Tywin sent me.
"
"ARYA: Lord Tywin gave it to me.
"
"ARYA: To take to the armory.
"
"ARYA: Amory Lorch.
"
"ARYA: Now!
"
"ARYA: But he's going to tell Tywin. He's getting away. It has to be now.
"
"ARYA: Yes, my lord.
"
"ARYA: I'll bring something else.
"
"ARYA: No.
"
"ARYA: I'll eat in the kitchen later.
"
"ARYA: I eat a lot. I just don't grow.
"
"ARYA: Have you ever lost before?
"
"ARYA: (shakes her head)
"
"ARYA: Dragons?
"
"ARYA: Aegon and his sisters.
"
"ARYA: It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.
"
"ARYA: Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.
"
"ARYA: Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
"
"ARYA: (smiles)
"
"ARYA: Most girls are idiots.
"
"ARYA: From my father.
"
"ARYA: Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?
"
"ARYA: My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord. She taught me how to speak proper Properly.
"
"ARYA: Yes.
"
"ARYA: Where's Jaqen?
"
"ARYA: Where's Jaqen?
"
"ARYA: I need him now. Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
"
"ARYA:  He's helping me.
"
"ARYA: Where?
"
"ARYA: Where?
"
"ARYA: Where?
"
"ARYA: I'm sorry. I'll
"
"ARYA: (annoyed) Where were you?
"
"ARYA: Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone.
"
"ARYA: How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?
"
"ARYA: He's taking his army to attack my brother. I need him dead right now.
"
"ARYA: You promised you'd help me.
"
"ARYA: And you'll kill them? Anybody?
"
"ARYA: All right. Jaqen H'ghar.
"
"ARYA:  That's right.
"
"ARYA:  I'm not joking. A man can go kill himself.
"
"ARYA: No.
"
"ARYA: I'll un-name you.
"
"ARYA:  If you help me and my friends escape.
"
"ARYA: Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.
"
"ARYA: A girl will obey.
"
"ARYA: He didn't say. He just said, ""Walk through the gates.""
"
"ARYA: He didn't say anything about the guards.
"
"ARYA: We have to trust him.
"
"ARYA: Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.
"
"ARYA: What are you doing here?
"
"ARYA: How did you know we'd come this way?
"
"ARYA: How did you kill those guards? Was it hard?
"
"ARYA: Where?
"
"ARYA: My dancing master was from Braavos.
"
"ARYA: I want to. But I can't. I need to find my brother and mother. And my sister. I need to find her, too.
"
"ARYA: What is it?
"
"ARYA: Could it buy a horse?
"
"ARYA: Then what good is it?
"
"ARYA: Valar Morghulis.
"
"ARYA: Please don't go, Jaqen.
"
"ARYA: Valar Morghulis.
"
"ARYA: Would you please shut up about it?
"
"ARYA: I'm not listening.
"
"ARYA: Shut up.
"
"ARYA: Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?
"
"ARYA: Where are we going?
"
"ARYA: If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now.
"
"ARYA: It's 100 feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather he's a lord. He'll protect us.
"
"ARYA: Shut up.
"
"ARYA: Shh.
"
"ARYA: Don't.
"
"ARYA: You go on down the road. Just keep on singing so we know where you are. Leave us be and I won't kill you.
"
"ARYA: What friends?
"
"ARYA: Who are you?
"
"ARYA: No, who do you fight for?
"
"ARYA: I don't drink ale.
"
"ARYA: We're not children.
"
"ARYA: Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.
"
"ARYA: Gendry stole us weapons.
"
"ARYA: He knows how to use a sword and so do I.
"
"ARYA: My brothers taught me.
"
"ARYA: You'll free us?
"
"ARYA: Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?
"
"ARYA:  What am I?
"
"ARYA: So I can walk away, then?
"
"ARYA:  You remember the last time you were here?
"
"ARYA:  What are you doing? We're about to leave.  Hot PIE: I'm staying.
"
"ARYA: Winterfell.
"
"ARYA: I'm sure.  Hot PIE: Well, I made you something.
"
"ARYA: What is it?
"
"ARYA:	 That's the tail?
"
"ARYA: Good-bye, Hot Pie.
"
"ARYA: Hey, Hot Pie. It's really good.
"
"ARYA: Can I take this hood off yet?
"
"ARYA: What is it?
"
"ARYA: Ugh!
"
"ARYA: You murdered Mycah. The butchers boy. My friend. He was 12 years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.
"
"ARYA: That's a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.
"
"ARYA: Kill him!
"
"ARYA: No! ARYA: Let go of me! Let me go!
"
"ARYA: Burn in hell!
"
"ARYA: You can't let him go. He's a murderer. He's guilty.
"
"ARYA: You can't!
"
"ARYA: What are you doing?
"
"ARYA: Why?
"
"ARYA: Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet.
"
"ARYA: You don't have to do this.
"
"ARYA: Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow. And then you--
"
"ARYA: You just said you were serving Lord Beric.
"
"ARYA: I can be your family.
"
"ARYA: Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me?
"
"ARYA: I'm a hostage and you're selling me.
"
"ARYA: But it is that way.
"
"ARYA: More is than isn't.
"
"ARYA: So why don't you?
"
"ARYA: No.
"
"ARYA: I thought he killed you.
"
"ARYA: But how?
"
"ARYA: Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once.
"
"ARYA: I would. You're alive.
"
"ARYA: Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne.
"
"ARYA: What?
"
"ARYA: But I have to aim.
"
"ARYA: Never aim?
"
"ARYA: There's someone out there.
"
"ARYA: I don't like that woman.
"
"ARYA: What does that have to do with anything?
"
"ARYA: What are you doing? Let go of him.
"
"ARYA: Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!
"
"ARYA: Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?
"
"ARYA: You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold.
"
"ARYA: You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.
"
"ARYA: I don't talk to traitors.
"
"ARYA: But you did. You took the gold and you gave him up.
"
"ARYA: He's not my one true god.
"
"ARYA:  Death.
"
"ARYA: But what about Riverrun? It's not south. It's west of here.
"
"ARYA: You swore.
"
"ARYA: Why? So you can steal their gold?
"
"ARYA: I don't care what you swear because you're a liar. You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. You'll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all.
"
"ARYA: There's no one worse than you.
"
"ARYA: You're lying.
"
"ARYA: Is that the Blackwater?
"
"ARYA:  Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.
"
"ARYA: But why?
"
"ARYA: Why would they be at the Twins?
"
"ARYA: Don't! Don't kill him.
"
"ARYA: You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people.  A real hard man you are.
"
"ARYA: You're wrong.  I know a killer. A real killer.
"
"ARYA: You'd be like a kitten to him.  He'd kill you with his little finger.
"
"ARYA: No.
"
"ARYA: Don't kill him!  Please.  Please don't.
"
"ARYA:  No one’s going to believe you’re a hog farmer if you eat them all.
"
"ARYA: I know they’re still there.
"
"ARYA: I’m not afraid.
"
"ARYA: I knew fear when I saw it in you.  You’re afraid of fire.
"
"ARYA: When Beric’s sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl.
"
"ARYA: And I know why, too.  I heard what your brother did to you.  Pressed your face to the fire like you’re a nice juicy mutton chop.
"
"ARYA: Might do.
"
"ARYA: Someday I’m gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.
"
"ARYA: Mind if I keep warm?  Frey Soldier #2: Fuck off.
"
"ARYA: But I'm hungry.
"
"ARYA: I've got money.
"
"ARYA: It's worth a lot.
"
"ARYA: Sorry.
"
"ARYA: From you.
"
"ARYA: The first man.
"
"ARYA: (whispers) Valar morghulis.
"
"ARYA: When am I going to get a horse of my own?
"
"ARYA: The little lady wants away from your stench.
"
"ARYA: Why don't you have any money? Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?
"
"ARYA: You're not very smart, are you?
"
"ARYA: You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?
"
"ARYA: You think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one.
"
"ARYA: I'm hungry. You're hungry.
"
"ARYA: I know him. The small one. His name is Polliver. He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.
"
"ARYA: He killed Lommy.
"
"ARYA: He was my friend. Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck. He's still got it.
"
"ARYA: My sword Needle.
"
"ARYA: Lots of people name their swords.
"
"ARYA: My brother gave me that sword.
"
"ARYA:  He killed my friend.
"
"ARYA: Something wrong with your leg, boy?
"
"ARYA: Can you walk? I've got to carry you?
"
"ARYA: Fine little blade.
"
"ARYA: Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
"
"ARYA: Gonna rain soon. Where are we?
"
"ARYA: You think? You don't have a map?
"
"ARYA: Maybe we should get one.
"
"ARYA: How far is it to the Eyrie?
"
"ARYA: And you're sure we're going the right way?
"
"ARYA: On your way where?
"
"ARYA: I'd like to see Braavos one day.
"
"ARYA: I have friends there.
"
"ARYA: We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.
"
"ARYA: He's never been the same.
"
"ARYA: The Tullys of Riverrun.
"
"ARYA: Father!
"
"ARYA: I'm so sorry.
"
"ARYA: Really good.
"
"ARYA: What did you do?!
"
"ARYA: You told me you weren't a thief.
"
"ARYA: He took us in. He fed us and you...
"
"ARYA: You don't know that.
"
"ARYA: You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.
"
"ARYA: Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.
"
"ARYA: I can't sleep until I say the names.
"
"ARYA: Only the ones I'm going to kill.
"
"ARYA: If he were here right now, what would you do?
"
"ARYA: I'm almost done. Only one name left.
"
"ARYA: The Hound.
"
"ARYA: Practicing.
"
"ARYA:  No one's going to kill me.
"
"ARYA: It's not fighting. It's water dancing.
"
"ARYA: The greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos.
"
"ARYA: What do you know about anything?
"
"ARYA: It was not.
"
"ARYA:  Yes.
"
"ARYA: He was killed.
"
"ARYA: Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn...
"
"ARYA:  He was outnumbered.
"
"ARYA: Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.
"
"ARYA: Could be soldiers.
"
"ARYA: You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.
"
"ARYA: So why go on?
"
"ARYA: Nothing could be worse than this.
"
"ARYA: Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.
"
"ARYA: My name is Arya. Arya Stark.
"
"ARYA: You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.
"
"ARYA: He can't be. I don't know his name.
"
"ARYA: Thank you.
"
"ARYA: You're doing it wrong. You need to burn away that horrible bit there. Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester. I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right--
"
"ARYA: It'll only take a second. It won't hurt that much.
"
"ARYA: Why?
"
"ARYA: Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
"
"ARYA: Lots of things make me happy.
"
"ARYA: Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.
"
"ARYA: At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
"
"ARYA: You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?
"
"ARYA: That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
"
"ARYA: You should have let me burn it.
"
"ARYA: That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
"
"ARYA: You really think my aunt will pay for me?
"
"ARYA: I've never even met her.
"
"ARYA: I'm not a lady.
"
"ARYA: People coming. You can shit later, there’s people coming!
"
"ARYA: Morning.
"
"ARYA: About ten more miles.
"
"ARYA: Are you a knight?
"
"ARYA: But you know how to use that sword.
"
"ARYA: Does it have a name?
"
"ARYA: Mine’s “Needle.”
"
"ARYA: Who taught you how to fight?
"
"ARYA: Mine never wanted to. Said fighting was for boys.
"
"ARYA: My mother’s dead.
"
"ARYA: You’re not a northerner.
"
"ARYA: Why didn’t you?
"
"ARYA: The Bloody Gate’s ten miles.
"
"ARYA: I don’t care what you swore!
"
"ARYA: I don’t need saving.
"
"ARYA: You’re gonna die?
"
"ARYA: I’ll last longer than you.
"
"ARYA: I want to see the captain.
"
"ARYA: I want to go north, to the wall.
"
"ARYA: I can pay.
"
"ARYA: I wouldn’t need a cabin. Please, I could work, scrubbing the floors, or…
"
"ARYA: Where’s home?
"
"ARYA: Wait, I have something else.
"
"ARYA: It’s not silver, it’s iron.
"
"ARYA: Valar morghulis.
"
"ARYA: He's just a statue.
"
"ARYA: I'm not afraid.
"
"ARYA: Thank you for bringing me.
"
"ARYA: Valar dohaeris.
"
"ARYA: Hello. Valar Morghulis.
"
"ARYA: Jaqen H’ghar gave me this.
"
"ARYA: Please. I crossed the Narrow Sea. I have nowhere else to go.
"
"ARYA: But wait!
"
"ARYA: Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant. Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant.
"
"ARYA: ...The Mountain, Meryn Trant.
"
"ARYA: Turn around and go. (pulls out Needle) Turn around and go.
"
"ARYA: Nothing's worth anything to dead men.
"
"ARYA: Who are you? Why were they scared of you?
"
"ARYA: You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.
"
"ARYA: Well who are you then?
"
"ARYA: I've been sweeping this floor for days.
"
"ARYA: I didn't come here to sweep floors.
"
"ARYA: You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.
"
"ARYA: I want to serve. (Jaqen stops).
"
"ARYA: Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.
"
"ARYA: Where are they taking him?
"
"ARYA: What do you want?
"
"ARYA: What?
"
"ARYA: (After a moment, perks up). No one.
"
"ARYA: Ow! Cunt!
"
"ARYA: You're about to find out.
"
"ARYA: (Stands up). I am ready.
"
"ARYA: What do we do with them after we wash them?
"
"ARYA: What are they doing with the bodies?
"
"ARYA: No! I’ve been here for weeks. I’m not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I’m doing it.
"
"ARYA: When?
"
"ARYA: When do I get to play the game?
"
"ARYA: The game. The game of faces.
"
"ARYA: I didn’t even know I was playing.
"
"ARYA: No one.
"
"ARYA: Well who are you? What are you doing here? How’d you get here?
"
"ARYA: What?
"
"ARYA: Arya.
"
"ARYA: Westeros. My family home is Winterfell. I’m the youngest daughter of a great lord. Eddard Stark. He died in battle.
"
"ARYA: After he was executed I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back.
"
"ARYA: I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver.
"
"ARYA: A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him but I wouldn’t. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer, I hated him.
"
"ARYA: I hated him.
"
"ARYA: I hated him!
"
"ARYA: That’s not a lie!
"
"ARYA: Yes.
"
"ARYA: I’m not playing this stupid game anymore!
"
"ARYA: Valar dohaeris.
"
"ARYA: I know. Don’t be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me.
"
"ARYA: I’ve devoted my life to him now. You don’t want to hurt anymore. Drink.
"
"ARYA: My name is Lana. I’m an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more.
"
"ARYA (V.O.): Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--
"
"ARYA: Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade.
"
"ARYA: How will she serve him?
"
"ARYA: What will she do there?
"
"ARYA: See what?
"
"ARYA: Oysters, clams and cockles!
"
"ARYA: Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!
"
"ARYA: Best in the city.
"
"ARYA: So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
"
"ARYA: If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money.
"
"ARYA: The Many Faced God. You said you didn’t know what I would see at the docks.
"
"ARYA: And then what?
"
"ARYA: Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock--
"
"ARYA: Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels!
"
"ARYA: Three coppers.
"
"ARYA: The Thin Man wasn’t hungry today.
"
"ARYA: Tomorrow.
"
"ARYA: You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. I’ve gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. I’m glad he left me you. Do you know who I am?
"
"ARYA: I can’t hear you.
"
"ARYA: You know who I am. I’m Arya Stark.
"
"ARYA: Do you know who you are?
"
"ARYA: You’re no one. You’re nothing.
"
"ARYA: No! No! No, you don’t die! Don’t die! (sobs)
"
"ARYA: He was my friend.
"
"ARYA: But if you’re… (looks to the Jaqen who drank the potion and is seemingly dead) Who’s this?
"
"ARYA: I can’t see!
"
"ARYA: What’s happening?! What’s happening?!
"
"ARYA: Thank you.
"
"ARYA: I can’t see.
"
"ARYA: No one.
"
"ARYA: No one.
"
"ARYA: A girl has no name.
"
"ARYA: A girl has no name.
"
"ARYA: A girl has no name.
"
"ARYA: No one.
"
"ARYA: Arya Stark.
"
"ARYA: Her father was Eddard Stark. Her mother was Catelyn Stark. She had one sister, Sansa, and four brothers.
"
"ARYA: Three brothers.
"
"ARYA (V.O.): Rob, Bran, Rickon. And a half-brother, Jon.
"
"ARYA (V.O.): They may be dead for all a girl knows.
"
"ARYA (V.O.): Also dead.
"
"ARYA: Arya Stark left him to die. He was on her list.
"
"ARYA: He was not on her list anymore. She’d taken him off it.
"
"ARYA: She did and she did not.
"
"ARYA: Yes, she was.
"
"ARYA (V.O.): Cersei Lannister, Gregor Clegane, Walder Frey.
"
"ARYA: Which name would you like a girl to speak?
"
"ARYA: A girl has no name.
"
"ARYA: No one.
"
"ARYA: Who was the first?
"
"ARYA: Where did they go?
"
"ARYA: A girl has no desires.
"
"ARYA: Who?
"
"ARYA: A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.
"
"ARYA: If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall…
"
"ARYA: She’s a good actress.
"
"ARYA: Seems like a decent woman.
"
"ARYA: No. Who wants her dead?
"
"ARYA: The younger actress. She’s jealous because Lady Crane is better.
"
"ARYA: A girl has decided.
"
"ARYA: Nothing.
"
"ARYA: Three times.
"
"ARYA: No.
"
"ARYA: You’re very good.
"
"ARYA: So change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.
"
"ARYA: The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn’t just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.
"
"ARYA: Mercy.
"
"ARYA: I have to go. My father’s waiting for me.
"
"ARYA: Careful of that one. She wants you dead.
"
"ARYA: You’re Westerosi.
"
"ARYA: I want to book passage home.
"
"ARYA: Why do you care?
"
"ARYA: I want a cabin. And we’ll leave at dawn.
"
"ARYA: See you at sunrise.
"
"ARYA: You’re good at that. Where did you learn?
"
"ARYA: And good at putting holes in them.
"
"ARYA: What happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead.
"
"ARYA: Mmm.
"
"ARYA: I can’t.
"
"ARYA: I don’t think I could remember all of the lines.
"
"ARYA: You wouldn’t be safe. Not while she’s looking for me.
"
"ARYA: She doesn’t have a name.
"
"ARYA: Essos is east and Westeros is west. But what’s west of Westeros?
"
"ARYA: Nobody does. That’s where all the maps stop.
"
"ARYA: I’d like to see that.
"
"ARYA: What’s that?
"
"ARYA: I don’t want any.
"
"ARYA: Lady Crane?
"
"ARYA: Lady Crane?
"
"ARYA: You told her to kill me.
"
"ARYA: A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I’m going home.
"
"ARYA: My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing you’re ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.
"
"ARYA: When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.
"
"ARYA: That's a pretty song. I've never heard it before.
"
"ARYA: I don't want to steal your food.
"
"ARYA: King's Landing.
"
"ARYA: Not so bad, is it?
"
"ARYA: What are you doing in the Riverlands?
"
"ARYA: Oh, no, I couldn't. You don't have enough.
"
"ARYA: You're a long way from home. I'm sure you've had some adventures, though.
"
"ARYA: Boy or girl?
"
"ARYA: Why?
"
"ARYA: It's really good.
"
"ARYA: I'm going to kill the queen.
"
"ARYA:  Hello, Hot Pie.  Sit down.  Who's that for?
"
"ARYA:  Mmm.  This is good.
"
"ARYA:  I didn't do that.
"
"ARYA:  One or two.
"
"ARYA:  Big lady?
"
"ARYA:  She found me.
"
"ARYA:  You got any ale?
"
"ARYA:  King's Landing.
"
"ARYA:  I heard Cersei's queen now.
"
"ARYA:  Hmm.
"
"ARYA:  Cersei would do that.
"
"ARYA:  Why would I go there?  The Boltons have it.
"
"ARYA:  What?
"
"ARYA:  You're lying.
"
"ARYA:  Thanks for the pie.
"
"ARYA:  Thanks.
"
"ARYA:  Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.  Try not to get killed.
"
"ARYA:  Nymeria?
"
"ARYA:  Nymeria, it's me, Arya.  I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell.  I'm finally going home.  Come with me.
"
"ARYA:  Come with me.
"
"ARYA:  That's not you.
"
"ARYA:  In there.  I live here.
"
"ARYA:  I'm Arya Stark.  This is my home.
"
"ARYA:  Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick.  They'll tell you who I am.
"
"ARYA:  Go ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North.  He's my brother
"
"ARYA:  If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?
"
"ARYA:  Which Lady Stark?
"
"ARYA:  Tell Sansa her sister is home.
"
"ARYA:  I'm getting into this castle one way or another.  If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long.  But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away...
"
"ARYA:  Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?
"
"ARYA:  I didn't run.  You need better guards.
"
"ARYA:  It suits you, Lady Stark.  Jon left you in charge?
"
"ARYA:  That doesn't look like him.  It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.
"
"ARYA:  We're not.
"
"ARYA:  They say you killed Joffrey.  Did you?
"
"ARYA:  Me too.  I was angry when I heard someone else had done it.  However long my list got he was always first.
"
"ARYA:  Of people I'm going to kill.
"
"ARYA:  It's a long story.  I imagine yours is too.
"
"ARYA:  Mine neither, but our stories aren't over yet.
"
"ARYA:  You saw me?
"
"ARYA:  So did I.
"
"ARYA:  Most of them are dead already.
"
"ARYA:  Where did you get this?
"
"ARYA:  Littlefinger, he's here?
"
"ARYA:  Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?
"
"ARYA:  Are you sure?  It's Valyrian steel.
"
"ARYA:  Don't fight someone like her in the first place.
"
"ARYA(TO BRIENNE):  It's been awhile since I've trained.
"
"ARYA:  He didn't beat the hound.  You did.  I want to train with you.
"
"ARYA:  You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?
"
"ARYA:  I won't cut you.  Don't worry.
"
"ARYA:  No one.
"
"ARYA:  He didn't.  He trusted you to hold it for him.
"
"ARYA:  These are mother and father's chambers.
"
"ARYA:  Nothing.
"
"ARYA:  What?
"
"ARYA:  You always liked nice things.  It made you feel better than everyone.
"
"ARYA:  They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.
"
"ARYA:  Their opinions are important to you?
"
"ARYA:  Not if they lose their heads first.
"
"ARYA:  And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want.
"
"ARYA:  You're thinking it right now.  You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away.
"
"ARYA:  My lady.
"
"ARYA:  Father used to watch us from up here.  He wouldn't say much.  You probably don't remember.  You were inside knitting all the time.
"
"ARYA:  One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick.  I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground.  Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw.  There was one arrow in the target.  There was no one around, just like now.  No one to stop me.  So I started shooting.  And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again.  I wasn't very good.  Finally I hit the bullseye.  It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th.  I don't remember.  But I hit the bullseye and I heard this.
"
"ARYA:  I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me.  I knew what I was doing was against the rules.  But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong.  The rules were wrong.  I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it.  Now he's dead.  Killed by the Lannisters with your help.
"
"ARYA:  That's your pretty handwriting.  Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you.  ""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart.  Our good King Robert is dead.  Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --
"
"ARYA:  ""Father has been charged with treason.  He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne.  The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort.  I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark.  Your faithful sister, Sansa.""
"
"ARYA:  Did they.  With a knife at your throat?  Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
"
"ARYA:  So was I.  I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
"
"ARYA:  And you were stupid enough to believe them.  I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block.  I remember the pretty dress you were wearing.  I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
"
"ARYA:  I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
"
"ARYA:  I wanted to.
"
"ARYA:  I didn't betray him.  I didn't betray Robb.  I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
"
"ARYA:  I was training.
"
"ARYA:  Oh, I don't know about that.  I can imagine quite a lot.
"
"ARYA:  I guess we'll never know.
"
"ARYA:  I don't know yet.
"
"ARYA:  You're scared, aren't you?  What are you scared of?  You didn't commit any crimes.  No one's going to hang you.
"
"ARYA:  Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry?  No.  That's not Jon.  He'll understand.  You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.
"
"ARYA:  The northern lords will read it.  They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding.  What would little Lyanna Mormont say?  She's younger than you were when you wrote this.  Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?
"
"ARYA:  Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things.  I'll go with anger.
"
"ARYA: Are you sure you want to do this?
"
"ARYA: And what does honor demand?
"
"ARYA: All right, then. Get on with it.
"
"ARYA: My sister asked you a question.
"
"ARYA: You told our mother
"
"ARYA: Are you all right?
"
"ARYA: You did the right thing.
"
"ARYA: I'm just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You're the Lady.
"
"ARYA: I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived.
"
"ARYA: I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
"
"ARYA: ""In winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another.""
"
"ARYA: I miss him.
"
"ARYA (O.S.): You used to be taller.
"
"ARYA: How did you survive a knife through the heart?
"
"ARYA: Needle.
"
"ARYA: Once or twice.
"
"ARYA: Valyrian steel.
"
"ARYA: Too heavy for me.
"
"ARYA: She doesn't like your queen, does she?
"
"ARYA: She's the smartest person I've ever met.
"
"ARYA: I'm defending our family. So is she.
"
"ARYA: Don't forget that.
"
"ARYA (O.S.): Leave him be.
"
"ARYA: First I robbed you.
"
"ARYA: That was a nice ax you made for him. You've gotten better.
"
"ARYA: Thanks. So do you.
"
"ARYA: Stay close to that forge, then.
"
"ARYA: Don't call me that.
"
"ARYA: Here's my wish.
"
"ARYA: Can you make it?
"
"ARYA: Can you make it or not?
"
"ARYA: You don't know any other rich girls.
"
"ARYA: You make my weapon yet?
"
"ARYA: You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.
"
"ARYA: Are you going to be down in the crypt?
"
"ARYA: But you're a fighter.
"
"ARYA: You've fought them?
"
"ARYA: How many?
"
"ARYA: What are they like?
"
"ARYA: ""Really bad""?
"
"ARYA: Even a smith's apprentice can do better than ""really bad."" What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?
"
"ARYA: I know Death.
"
"ARYA: He's got many faces.
"
"ARYA: I look forward to seeing this one.
"
"ARYA: My weapon?
"
"ARYA: We're not leaving you alone out there.
"
"ARYA: Dragonfire will stop him?
"
"ARYA: Guess I've changed.
"
"ARYA: What are you doing up here?
"
"ARYA: No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond the Wall with Jon. You're here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?
"
"ARYA: For a little while.
"
"ARYA: I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.
"
"ARYA: That for me?
"
"ARYA: This'll work.
"
"ARYA: What did the Red Woman want with you?
"
"ARYA: Why your blood?
"
"ARYA: Was that your first time?
"
"ARYA: Your first time with a woman.
"
"ARYA: Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?
"
"ARYA: Or after?
"
"ARYA: You don't remember?
"
"ARYA: One? Two? Twenty?
"
"ARYA: Yes, you did.
"
"ARYA: We're probably going to die soon. I want to know what it's like before that happens.
"
"ARYA: I'm not the Red Woman. Take your own bloody pants off.
"
"ARYA: I am celebrating.
"
"ARYA: Congratulations.
"
"ARYA: You'll be a wonderful lord, and any lady would be lucky to have you. But I'm not a lady. I never have been. That's not me.
"
"ARYA: We need a word.
"
"ARYA: I respect that.
"
"ARYA: We needed her. We needed her army, her dragons. You did the right thing. And we're doing the right thing telling you we don't trust your queen.
"
"ARYA:  I'll never know her. She's not one of us.
"
"ARYA: That's all right. I don't need many allies.
"
"ARYA: We're family. The four of us. The last of the Starks.
"
"ARYA: You're my brother. Not my half-brother or my bastard brother. My brother.
"
"ARYA: What is it?
"
"ARYA: I swear it.
"
"ARYA: Me neither.
"
"ARYA: Don't like heroes.
"
"ARYA: Felt better than dying. You're heading to King's Landing?
"
"ARYA: Me too.
"
"ARYA: Neither do I.
"
"ARYA:  Probably.
"
"ARYA: I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.
"
"ARYA: Try telling Sansa.
"
"ARYA: Jon. She knows who you are. Who you really are. You'll always be a threat to her. And I know a killer when I see one.
"
"ARYA: Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.
"
"ARYA: I can't.
"
"ARYA: (chuckles)  I'm not going back north.
"
"ARYA: What's west of Westeros?
"
"ARYA: No one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going.
"
"ARYA: Right here.
"
